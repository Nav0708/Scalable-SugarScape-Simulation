# Sugarscape Agent-Based Model
---
Welcome to the Sugarscape Agent-Based Model! This Python implementation is based on the Sugarscape model introduced in "Growing Artificial Societies" by Epstein and Axtell. It allows for simulating the behavior of agents in a dynamic environment where they collect and consume resources, interact with each other, and make decisions based on various decision models.

## Features

- Implementation of the Sugarscape model with customizable parameters.
- Various decision models for agent decision-making.
- Dynamic environment with resource regrowth, pollution, and seasonal changes.
- Scalable simulations with HTCondor and Makeflow.
- Data collection and visualization capabilities.
- Easy-to-use interface with TkInter.

## Requirements

- Bash
- Python 3
- TkInter

## Usage

To run the simulation, simply execute the following command:

```
python sugarscape.py
```

For more advanced usage and options, refer to the Makefile options and JSON configuration file options in the documentation.
